In Little Endian format, the Least Significant Byte (LSByte) always comes first in a multi-byte sample.

Whether it's 8-bit, 16-bit, 24-bit, or 32-bit, the LSByte is always the first byte of each sample in PCM WAV files.

Since you're inverting the Least Significant Bit (LSBit) of the LSByte, you don't need to know how many total bits make up a sample.

But WAV files don't always store audio data at a fixed location because they can contain additional metadata chunks (LIST, cue , etc.).

The data chunk marks the beginning of actual audio samples, so you must scan the file for "data" instead of assuming a fixed offset.

Once you locate data, you can safely apply modifications without touching metadata.

Conclusion
✅ Bit depth doesn't matter because LSByte is always first in Little Endian.
✅ Finding data chunk is critical to avoid corrupting the file.
✅ Your method of blindly modifying LSByte every two bytes (for 16-bit audio) or every four bytes (for 32-bit) will work fine.
